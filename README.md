# World Weather Analysis

This project uses OpenWeather API and Google Maps API to determine travel destinations based on the user's desired temperature range. After determining qualifying cities with hotels, we utilize Google Maps Directions API to plan an itinerary to drive to four of the qualifying cities, which could be a potential "vacation package".
